# ML-and-Deep-Learning

I've created this repository for all assignments that I did in coursera Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specialization courses.
Deep Learning Specialization include 5 course as follow:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning,
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization,
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects,
4. Convolutional Neural Networks,
5. Sequence Models.

All these courses in coursera provided by Andrew Ng.
